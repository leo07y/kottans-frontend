<h1>0. Git Basics</h1>

My impressions of the material I've learned. Very accessible presentation of the material. I improved and systematized my knowledge of GIT while learning, and thanks to learngitbranching.js.org I got a good understanding of branching.

<h1>1. Linux CLI, and HTTP</h1>

After going through the four Linux Survival modules I have learned many basic commands from the terminal command line. During the training I practiced writing them in the Git Bash terminal, which I plan to use further in my work.

After reading the two articles on the HTTP protocol, I understood how requests and responses work between the client and the server, how connections are established, and also learned a lot of other useful information.
